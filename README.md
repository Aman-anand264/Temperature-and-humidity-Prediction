Temperature and Humidity Prediction Dashboard
An innovative project that monitors and predicts temperature and humidity using the DHT-11 sensor. It features a dashboard for real-time monitoring, historical data visualization, and future predictions using Machine Learning.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Displays current temperature and humidity data from the DHT-11 sensor.
Historical Analysis: Graphical visualization of temperature and humidity trends over past days.
Future Prediction: Predicts temperature and humidity for the next date using machine learning.
Data Storage: Utilizes MongoDB to store historical sensor data.

Technologies Used

Hardware
DHT-11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi): Interfaces the DHT-11 sensor with the system.

Software
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing sensor data.
Python: Backend programming language for data processing and machine learning.
Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, numpy

Frontend:
ReactJS: Interactive dashboard interface.
Chart.js (or equivalent): For graphical data representation.

Installation
Prerequisites
MongoDB installed or accessible as a cloud instance.
Python environment set up with required libraries.
Node.js installed for the frontend.
